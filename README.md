## Models

We upload the trained checkpoints and extrapolated models on HuggingFace.

For the `zephyr` checkpoints trained from `zephyr-7b-sft-full` in our controlled experiments (Section 3), see [here](https://huggingface.co/collections/chujiezheng/model-checkpoints-in-the-expo-paper-662b00fde58d277c81fb5bfb).

For the extrapolated models applied to open-source models (Section 4), see [here](https://huggingface.co/collections/chujiezheng/weak-to-strong-extrapolation-expedites-alignment-662b69fbe7850e722e10ff70).

## Experimental Results

We will release the AlpacaEval 2.0 evaluation results. TBD.

## Inference and Evaluation Code

TBD.
